# Code Career Academy JavaScript Objects and Arrays Demo 01

This repo is designed for our students to demonstrate the progression from simple variables to objects and arrays in JavaScript.

The project was built up, step by step in the commits.

If you start with the oldest commit it will be the simplest JavaScript with just plain variables.

If you step forwards through the commits, you can see the change to objects and an array ending up with a simple app that manages a list of customers.
